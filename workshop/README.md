# meta-aws-ci-workshop

### Setup:

This is how I set up my environment:

## On a Mac:
Install Hugo:
`brew install hugo`

## Clone this repo:
From wherever you checkout repos:
`git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/meta-aws-ci-worshop` (or your fork)

## On a Mac:
Run hugo:
`hugo server -D`

## View Hugo locally:
Visit http://localhost:1313/ to see the site.

## Making Edits:
As you save edits to a page, the site will live-reload to show your changes.

## Auto Deploy:
Any commits to main will auto build and deploy in a couple of minutes. You can see the currently deployed hash at the bottom of the menu panel.

note: shift-reload may be necessary in your browser to reflect the latest changes.
